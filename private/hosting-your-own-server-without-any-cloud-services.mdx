OKAY!!! So you have a nodejs server or any other server that you want to host. So you are thinking of using cloud services like AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc. But hosting a server on cloud services like these is not free... unless you are a student and have a student account. But what if you don't have a student account and you don't want to pay for hosting your server.
What if you want to host your server on your own. But you don't how to do it. 
Don't worry, I will show you how to do it.

In this article, I will show you how to host your server on your own without using any cloud services. 

## Getting Started

First of all, you need a server. You can use any server you want. A Raspberry Pi sounds nice for it. But you can use your own computer as well which is running 24/7 and has a good internet connection and running Linux.
Your server will stop working if your computer is turned off or your internet connection is lost.

### Getting your application ready

To host your application, you need to containerize your application. You can use Docker for it. 
An example of a Dockerfile for a nodejs application is given below.

```dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

This Dockerfile will create a docker image of your application. 
You can build this image using the following command.

```bash
docker build -t <your username>/node-web-app .
```

Now publish this image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). You can publish this image using the following command.

```bash
docker push <your username>/node-web-app
```

> You need to create an account on Docker Hub to publish your image and you must be logged in to your account to publish your image.

### Getting a domain name

> Its difficult to remember an IP address. Reason why we use domain names. DNS is used to map domain names to IP addresses.

You can get a domain from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). Its your choice which domain you want to buy and you may skip it if you dont want to use a domain name.

### Getting a static IP address

> A static IP address is an IP address that doesn't change. A static IP address is useful for hosting servers.

You can get a static IP address from your ISP. You may skip this step if you don't want to use a static IP address.
But if you are using a Raspberry Pi, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get a static IP address. 
You can install ngrok using the following command.

```bash
npm install ngrok -g
```

You can get a static IP address using the following command.

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

### Setting up DNS records

> DNS records are used to map domain names to IP addresses.

You can set up DNS records using the following command.

```bash
A Record @ <your static IP address>
A Record www <your static IP address>
```

This step was only for mapping your domain name to your static IP address. You may skip this step if you don't want to use a domain name or a static IP address.

## Hosting your server

### Installing Docker

We need to install Docker on our server. You can install Docker using the following command.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

### Installing Nginx

Next we need to install Nginx. You can install Nginx using the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Configuring Nginx

Once successfully installed, we need to configure Nginx. You can configure Nginx using the following command.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

You need to replace the contents of the file with the following.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <your domain name>
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }
}
```

<Callout emoji="üö®">
Dont forget to replace `your domain name` with your domain name or `your static IP address` with your static IP address.
</Callout>

### Starting Nginx

Now you can start Nginx using the following command.

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```


### Running your server

Now you can run your server using the following command on your server host.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d <your username>/node-web-app
```

> Dont forget to verify the port number in the Dockerfile and the Nginx configuration file.

### Time for the final result

Now you can visit your domain name or your static IP address in your browser and you will see your application running.

## Conclusion

I just saved you some money. You can use this money to buy me a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è. LMFAO........
