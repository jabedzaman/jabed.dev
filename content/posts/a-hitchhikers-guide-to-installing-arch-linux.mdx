Have you ever been in a tech-savvy conversation and heard someone casually drop the line, "I use Arch Linux, by the way"?

![I-use-arch-btw](https://cdn.jabed.dev/i-use-arch-btw.png)

It's almost like a badge of honor in the Linux worldâ€”a symbol of elite knowledge and unyielding determination. You might have found yourself intrigued, even envious, and thought, "I want to be that person."

But, there's a catch, right? A certain mystique around Arch Linux, an aura of complexity, and an infamous reputation for having the steepest learning curve in the Linux ecosystem. The thought of diving into the Arch Wiki might send shivers down your spine, and you're not alone in feeling this way. In this blog I am going to help you out installing arch...

> This is just a guide to minimal arch install, in the upcoming blog I will explain how to setup a desktop profile

## Boot into the live environment

Visit the official [archlinux](https://archlinux.org) page and download the ISO. After that burn that into any USB using any tool depending on which environment you are. Next boot into it...

## Connecting to the internet

 The next challenge is connecting to the internet. To connect to the internet we are going to use the `iwctl` utility. Type the command to start the interactive utility. After that use `device list` command to display the available WiFi interfaces on your system. Use `station wlan0 scan` then `station wlan0 get-networks` to display available netowrks. To connect to one use `station wlan0 connect REPLACE_WITH_SSID` to connect to that network.

 If you had a ethernet connection you can skip this.

## Doing the partitons

Its time to create the partitons!! In the arch wiki they preferd to use `fdisk` to that, but we will use `cfdisk`. When you enter the command you will get some similar output:

![cfdisk](https://cdn.jabed.dev/arch-install-cfdisk.png)

Delete all the prevoius partitons and make four partitons for swap, boot, root and home. I prefer making a separate home partiton cause if system is to be upgraded or reinstalled, can be done without affecting user data. Now for boot give it 512M and swap of 4G. Now for the root and home its acording to you. Give your home partiton more space. Now its time to format all of them. 

Use the command `lsblk` to see the partiton labels.

Format the root and home with `ext4` format. It can be done this command:

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/your_root_partition
mkfs.ext4 /dev/your_home_partition
```

For the efi one, we have to format it with `FAT 32` format:

```bash
mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/your_boot_partiton
```

Lastly for the swap:

```bash
mkswap /dev/your_swap_partition
```

## Mounting the partitons

Create two new directory (one if you skippped creating a single root partiton) namely `/mnt/home` and `/mnt/boot/efi`
We then mount the partitons

```bash
mount /dev/your_root_partition /mnt
mount /dev/your_boot_partiton /mnt/boot/efi
mount /dev/your_home_partition /mnt/home # if yjou made a seperate home partiton
```

Turn on swap with `swapon /dev/your_swap_partition`

Use `lsblk` to verify if you did it correctly

## Installing 

Now we are going the install base, linux and linux-firmware. For the modern sound cards we need the sof-firmware also. For the text editor we will use neovim. We also need NetworkManager. We will install them with this command:

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware sof-firmware neovim NetworkManager
```

## Configure the system

Run the command `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab` to  automatically generate and append filesystem information to the /etc/fstab 

## Chrooting into the newly installed system

Run `arch-chroot /mnt` to chroot into the newly installed system. Now we will set the locale, timezone, user, etc.

To the set the timezone, run:

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
```

Now sync it with the system clock with ` hwclock --systohc`


Edit /etc/locale.gen and uncomment en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and other needed UTF-8 locales. Generate the locales by running `locale-gen`. Create the locale.conf file, and set the LANG variable accordingly.

```bash
# /etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

Now lets give our new beast a name. Edit the `/etc/hostname` to give your system a name.

Set the root password with the command 'passwd'.

Now lets create a user...
Run:

```bash
useradd -m -G rig -s /bin/bash jabed # replace with your name
passwd jabed # to set the passwd
```

Now lets promote the new user to be a superuser. Run:
```
EDITOR=nvim visudo
```

Now scroll and uncomment the line with the group we created `rig`

Now the last thing is to enable the NetworkManager daemons, run the command `systemctl enable NetworkManager` to enable it.

## Installing the bootlaoder

Now we need a bootloader for our system. In this guide, we will install **GRUB**. Firstly lets the install the dependencies:

```bash
pacman -S grub efibootimgr
```

Next, lets install it:

```bash
grub-intsall /dev/your_disk
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## WE ARE DONE!!!

Unmount all the partitons with `unmount -a` and reboot the system. 
CROSS FINGERS and you are into your system!!!


Now you can also become the `I USE ARCH BTW` guy!! Congrats!!!
