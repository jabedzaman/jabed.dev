Back in the day, during my high school and early college years, I was one of those die-hard Linux geeks with an ultra-sophisticated setup. My rig was a playground for endless customizations, themes, and tweaks. But as time went on, I realized I was investing more time in pimping my system than actually getting work done. I was running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) with [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) as my tiling window manager, always updating my dotfiles to keep my dev workflow sharp and my system **blazingly fast**. Yet, I found myself constantly fixing my distro instead of being productive 🙃.

Then, everything changed when I stumbled upon one of [Theo's](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) videos showcasing his [dev environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj1a7QuwjSI). That was my **fk it** moment. I realized just how much effort I was sinking into making my workspace **blazingly fast**. So, I made the leap and joined the Apple ecosystem, switching to **macOS** 🍎.

These days, my setup is all about simplicity and efficiency. 
I've streamlined my workflow and now rely on 
- [13-inch MacBook Air (16GB RAM, M2 chip)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/13-inch-midnight-apple-m2-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-8gb-memory-512gb)
- [Galaxy S23 (8GB RAM, 128GB storage)](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s23/buy/?modelCode=SM-S911BZGB&cid=in_pd_ppc_google_im-mobile-smartphone-all-dtc_sales_samsung-sseries(t2)-all-2024_eshop-pmax-pla_10jan2024-na_1ur-503224l-2024-eshop-bau-performancemax-cpc_pfm--20952045025------x--SM-S911BZGBINS&gad_source=1)
- [Samsung 980 Pro](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/980-pro-pcie-4-0-nvme-ssd-1tb-mz-v8p1t0b-am/) with an [orico ssd enclosre](https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-NVMe-Thunderbolt-Compatible-SSDs-PWM2-BK/dp/B0BJ23JTXX?th=1)


My approach is minimalistic yet powerful, focusing on a few essential tools that cover all my needs.

On my MacBook Air, I primarily use:
- **VSCode**: My go-to code editor, equipped with just the right extensions.
- **Postman**: For API testing and development.
- **Docker**: To avoid cluttering my system with numerous installations. I prefer running most tools and environments in containers.
- **Android Studio**: For mobile app development.
- **Xcode**: For iOS app development.
- **TG Pro**: To monitor and control my system's temperature.

I stick to the default macOS terminal, but I enhance it with **tmux** for session management. Additionally, I use a few handy tools:
- **zoxide**: A smarter way to navigate directories.
- **starship**: A fast, customizable, and minimalist prompt for the shell.

By using Docker, I keep my system clean and lightweight, running different environments and tools in isolated containers. This not only simplifies maintenance but also ensures a consistent setup across different projects. This streamlined setup allows me to stay productive without the overhead of constant system customization and maintenance.

Before becoming this matured apple sheep, I had been using various tools and setups to optimize my workflow.
These were the tools I used prevoiusly on my DELL Inspiron 15 series laptop with an Intel i5-1135G7 CPU and 16GB of RAM:

- the chad [arch](https://archlinux.org) ovio.
- [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) as my tiling window manager.
- [neovim](https://neovim.io) as my editor.
- [nemo](https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo) as my file manager.
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as a replacement for dmenu.
- [wezterm](https://github.com/wezterm) along with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).
- and the [zsh](https://zsh.org) as my shell.
- [zap](https://github.com/zap) for my prompt, autocomplitions, etc


>P.S. I actually dont have a waifu pillow
