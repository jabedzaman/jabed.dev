devstats is an open source project that provides a set of tools to visualize and analyze GitHub data.

This was one of the weekend projects that I built in a day. The idea was to build a tool that can visualize and analyze GitHub data stats to help me understand the current state of my projects and contributions.

## Technologies

- Next.js
- GraphQL
- @tanstack/react-table
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadcnUI
- Prisma
- Server Actions
- Auth.js
- TypeScript

## Workflow

The complete project is basically a wrapper around the GitHub graphql API.

Firstly, I authenticate the user using GitHub OAuth and then store the `access_token` in the database. Then I use this token to fetch the data from the GraphQL API.

And thats all! The data is then visualized using `@tanstack/react-table` thats it!
