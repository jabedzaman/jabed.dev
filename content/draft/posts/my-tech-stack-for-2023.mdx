Its 2023 soon and there are a lot of technologies to select from when building your side project which can make you feel overwhelmed. Choosing a wrong tech may make you endup rewriting your project from scratch. With the right tech stack, we can conquer anything the digital world throws our way.

"Ain't nobody got time for slow-loading websites," am I right? With [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), we can create blazing-fast, SEO-friendly applications in no time. The new app directory, [@next/fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization), image optimization, and [metdata api](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head) are some of the new features that make Next.js so great.

In the era of serverless and edge computing, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the best choice for frontend development. It supports serverless functions, edge caching, and a lot more. You no longer need to worry about setting up a server for the backend. You can just write your backend code in the app/api directory and it will be deployed as a serverless/edge function.

Edge functions are the future... I am gonna prefer them as it resolves the issues of cold starts and latency. To create an edge function, we just need to create a file in the app/api directory and export a function.

```ts
export const runtime = 'edge'

export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })
}
```

This function will be deployed as an edge function and will be executed at the edge. This means that the function will be executed at the nearest location to the user. This will reduce the latency and improve the performance of our app. And yes Typescript is must. I don't think I need to explain why.

And when it comes to frontend styling, TailwindCSS is the way to go. "Who has time to write custom CSS? Ain't nobody got time for that!" With TailwindCSS, we can create beautiful, responsive designs with pre-built components and easy-to-use class names.

```html
<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-center text-blue-500">Hello World!</p>
```

As easy as that!

Coming on to authentication, [authjs](https://authjs.dev) is the easiest and fastest way to add authentication to your Next.js app. It supports multiple providers like Google, Facebook, etc ...

OKAY NOW PERSISTING THE DATA ?? HOW DO WE DO THAT ??

Oviously we need a database. I was a firebase fan earlier ... but its 2023 and there are lot other compititors in the market. I would go with [planetScale](https://planetscale.com) for my database. Its a MySQL database with a lot of features like realtime updates, easy to use API, etc ...

Now the question is how do we connect our frontend to the database ??

[prisma](https://prisma.io) is the answer. Prisma is an ORM that makes it easy to connect our database to our frontend. It supports a lot of databases like MySQL, Postgres, etc ...

Now we have a frontend, a database, and a way to connect them. But how do we deploy our app ??

AWS would gonna be my choice for deploying my app.

JK!!! Once you get into the aws loop, you can't get out of it.
(Jeff gonna sue me for this)

So which??

[vercel](https://vercel.com), the one who made Next.js, is the best place to deploy our app.
[vercel](https://vercel.com) has a lot of features like [analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics), [monitoring](https://vercel.com/monitor), [edge network](https://vercel.com/edge-network), etc ... which makes it the best place to manage our app also ...

Its very easy to deploy our app to vercel.

```bash
pnpm i -g vercel # or whatever package manager you use
vercel login
vercel
```

And that's it. Our app is live.
