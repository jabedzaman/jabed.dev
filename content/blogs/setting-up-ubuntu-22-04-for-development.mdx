I just had a clean reinstall of the latest ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This meant I had to setup my coding environment again from the scratch. 

### Basic Setup
First run  `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to installl the updates.
Then later install the gnome tweaks 
``` sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool```
I prefer this to customize my gnome looks. 
- Turn on auto suspend on lid close
- Head to settings then make the dock auto hide and make it in panel mode and position on bottom. Not madatory but I like my screen to be clean.
- Ok optionally set a better wallpaper ðŸ¤“

### Basic apps
- Install chrome
- Install VLC
- Install curl
- Install VS code

### Setting up git
- run ```sudo apt install git``` to install git
- set ```git --global user.name "yourname" ```
- set ```git --global user.email "youremail" ```
- add ```ssh-keygen ```
- add the saved ssh key to your github account

### Customizing the terminal
I always prefer zsh over bash. First install zsh with the command ```sudo apt-get install zsh``` Set zsh to the default terminal ```chsh -s $(which zsh)``` 
Its not yet done!! <br/> 
Run ```sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"``` to setup the custom theme

Something like this... hehehe...

### Node setup
You can get the latest node version from the snap store.

### Mongo DB compass setup
Install compass from their offical website. You will get a .deb package which you can easily install to your system

### extensions
- Setup gnome extensions from [gnome-extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/)
This are the extensions which I use

### Other programmes
- Install android studio from their [wesbite](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqc6aBhC4ARIsAN06NmMCEkuk7muI5pkPS1tEd7Z3pDd4gsx0p048NWugvycVGuyu8i21HKAaAgXpEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
- Install Postman to test APIs
- Install java by ``` sudo apt install java```


*We are done. And this is how my desktop looks like *
