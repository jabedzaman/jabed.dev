There are a lot of deployment tools available in the market. But when it comes to self-hosted deployments, it becomes a bit tricky.
Tools like [coolify](https://www.coolify.io/) & [dokploy](https://dokploy.com/) exists but themsevles eat up a lot of resources and are complex to setup.
These tools are great but they turn out to be an overkill for me :)

The main key points I wanted to achieve were:

- **Automated deployments**: automate the deployment process as much as possible.
- **Resource-efficient**: Use as little resources as possible.
- **Self-hosted**: host the all deployment tools on my own server.
- **Simple**: keep the setup simple and easy to maintain, manage, and scale.

### Architecture

The architecture I came up with is as follows:

```bash
-> Build Docker image
-> Push to GHCR
-> Pull image on server
-> Run Image with Docker Compose
-> Use Nginx Proxy Manager to proxy requests to the container
-> Done!
```

### Automating the deployment

I used GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. Here is the workflow I used:

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image to GHCR

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      - name: Log in to GHCR
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest .
          docker push ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest
```

This workflow builds the Docker image and pushes it to GHCR on every push to the `main` branch and tags the image as `latest`.

Now, on the server, the initial setup is to install Docker and Docker Compose. Once that is done. Create a stack to run `Nginx Proxy Manager`.
Next we will add all our apps in this stack. Also make sure to login to GHCR on the server to pull the images. To login you can use the [personal tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
to authenticate with GHCR.

```bash
echo $GHCR_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u $GHCR_USERNAME --password-stdin
```

Now create a `docker-compose.yaml` file to run the apps. Here is an example:

```yaml
name: "apps"

services:
  npm:
    image: "jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt

  app:
    image: ghcr.io/jabedzaman/jabed.dev:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - app.env
```

The culture I follow is to organize the environment variables in a `<service>.env` file. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the environment variables.
In this way its easy to add identity secrets for the each service.

Next go the proxy manager and add a new proxy host. Add the domain name and the port where the service is running. The host
will be the name of the service along with the desired port of yours.

Now whenever you push to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will build the Docker image and push it to GHCR.
But this needs to be pulled on the server and run with Docker Compose. To automate this, I created a simple script that pulls the image and runs it with Docker Compose.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define color codes
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[0;33m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
CYAN='\033[0;36m'
RESET='\033[0m'

# Path to the docker-compose file
COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yaml"

# Check if docker-compose file exists
if [[ ! -f "$COMPOSE_FILE" ]]; then
  echo -e "${RED}docker-compose.yaml not found in the current directory.${RESET}"
  exit 1
fi

# Extract service names using yq and trim quotes
SERVICES=$(yq '.services | keys | .[]' "$COMPOSE_FILE" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '"')

# Check if yq executed successfully
if [[ $? -ne 0 || -z "$SERVICES" ]]; then
  echo -e "${RED}Failed to parse docker-compose.yaml. Ensure the file is valid and yq is properly installed.${RESET}"
  exit 1
fi

# Display the services with numbers
echo -e "${CYAN}Available services:${RESET}"
i=1
declare -A SERVICE_MAP
for SERVICE in $SERVICES; do
  echo -e "${GREEN}$i) $SERVICE${RESET}"
  SERVICE_MAP[$i]=$SERVICE
  ((i++))
done

# Prompt user for a choice
echo -e "${BLUE}"
read -p "Enter the number corresponding to the service you want to run: " CHOICE
echo -e "${RESET}"

# Validate the user input
if [[ -z "${SERVICE_MAP[$CHOICE]}" ]]; then
  echo -e "${RED}Invalid choice. Exiting.${RESET}"
  exit 1
fi

SELECTED_SERVICE=${SERVICE_MAP[$CHOICE]}
echo -e "${CYAN}You selected: ${GREEN}$SELECTED_SERVICE${RESET}"

# Pull the image for the selected service
echo -e "${BLUE}Pulling image for $SELECTED_SERVICE...${RESET}"
docker compose pull "$SELECTED_SERVICE"

# Bring up the selected service
echo -e "${BLUE}Starting $SELECTED_SERVICE...${RESET}"
docker compose up -d "$SELECTED_SERVICE"

echo -e "${GREEN}Service $SELECTED_SERVICE is up and running.${RESET}"
```

Now you need to have `yq` installed on your server to run this script. Also, make sure to make the script executable by running `chmod +x deploy.sh`.
You can also customize it to your needs

> Tip: Set the docker compose path in the script to the path where your `docker-compose.yaml` file is located and move the script to the `/usr/local/bin` directory to run it from anywhere.

Now, whenever you want to deploy a new service, just add it to the `docker-compose.yaml` file and run the script. It will pull the image and run it with Docker Compose.
And to update the service, just push the changes to the main branch and the GitHub Actions workflow will build the new image and push it to GHCR and you then only need to run the script to update the service.

### Further improvements

In the future, I plan to add move to a `k8s` setup. But for now, this setup is working great for me. It's simple, easy to maintain, and resource-efficient.

You can also use `github webhooks` to run the script whenever a new image is pushed to GHCR. This will automate the deployment process even further.
For this, you can use a simple REST API server that listens for the webhook and runs the script maybe using exec or something similar. And if you keep
the server in the stack (which would be a good idea), you can use `ssh2` to run the script on the server.
