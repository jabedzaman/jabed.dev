Lets take a situation where you have a web application which uses a database. You have to run both the application and database in separate containers. You can do this by using Docker. But what if you have to run multiple instances of the application and database? creating and running multiple containers is a tedious task. So how can we solve this problem?

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

> Docker Compose doesnt comes with Docker Desktop. You have to install it separately. To install Docker Compose, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Lets take a example to understand the basics of Docker Compose. We will create a simple web application which uses a database. We will use Docker Compose to run both the application and database in separate containers.

## Getting Started

Create a new directory and give it a name of your choice. For this demo I will name it `docker-compose-demo`
    ```bash
    mkdir docker-compose-demo
    cd docker-compose-demo
    ```
Now create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` . This is the file where we will define our application's services. It serves a similar purpose as `Dockerfile` but for multiple containers and acts as a config file for Docker Compose.

At the top of the file, we specify the version of Docker Compose we are using. For this demo we will use version 3.9. You can find the latest version [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/)

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    ```
Lets create a basic express server to serve our web application. In the terminal hit `npm init -y` to create a new node project. Then install express and pg using `npm install express pg`. Create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code to it.

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express')
    const pg = require('pg')
    
    const app = express()
    const port = 3000

    const pool = new Pool({
        user : 'root',
        host : 'db',
        database : 'mydb',
        password : 'example',
        port : 5430
    })

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        pool.query("SELECT NOW()", (error, result) => {
            if(error) {
                res.send(error)
            }
            res.send(`Connected to database. Current time: ${result.rows[0].now}`);
        })
    })

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`)
    })
    ```

Now in the `package.json` file, add the following script to start the server.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js"
    }
    ```

Now lets create a Dockerfile to build our application image. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` and add the following code to it.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:18

    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    COPY package*.json ./

    RUN yarn install

    COPY . .

    EXPOSE 3000

    CMD ["yarn", "start"]
    ```

Dont forget to add `.dockerignore` file to ignore `node_modules` folder.

    ```bash
    node_modules
    ```
Coming back to our `docker-compose.yml` , we need to define our services. In the example we will create two services namely db and app. Add the following code to out yaml file to define two containers.

    ```yaml
    services:
        db:
        app:
    ```

Now the first container named `db` will have a image of postgres. We will also define the environment variables for the container. Add the following code to the `db` service. Witht the help of port mapping we will map the port 5432 of the container to port 5432 of the host machine.

    ```yaml

    ```yaml
    db:
        image: postgres
        environment:
            POSTGRES_USER: root
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
            POSTGRES_DB: mydb
        ports:
            - "5432:5432"
    ```

Now for the app container, we will use the image we created using the Dockerfile. Add the following code to the `app` service. Witht the help of port mapping we will map the port 3000 of the container to port 3000 of the host machine.

    ```yaml
    app:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
    ```

Our app depends on the database. So we need to define the dependency. Add the following code to the `app` service.

    ```yaml
    depends_on:
        - db
    ```

Also Imagine if the container goes down then we will lose all the data. So we need to define a volume to persist the data. Add the following code to the `db` service.

    ```yaml
    volumes:
          - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```
Now we are done. Our `docker-compose.yml` file should look like this.

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"

    services:
        db:
            image: postgres
            environment:
                POSTGRES_USER: root
                POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
                POSTGRES_DB: mydb
            ports:
                - "5432:5432"
            volumes:
                - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        app:
            build: .
            ports:
                - "3000:3000"
            depends_on:
                - db
    ```

Time to build and run our application. In the terminal run the following command to build and run the application.

    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```
    ![docker-compose-build](/images/docker-compose-build.png)

Now lets start the application in detached mode. In the terminal run the following command to run the application in detached mode.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

Now we are done!!!

  ![docker-compose-up](/images/docker-compose-up.png)

To stop the application, run the following command.

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
     You can use <code>docker-compose log</code> to view the logs of the containers.

Hopefuly you have understood the basics of Docker Compose with the help of this demo.
